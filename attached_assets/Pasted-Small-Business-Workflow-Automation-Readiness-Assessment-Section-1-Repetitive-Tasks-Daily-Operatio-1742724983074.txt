Small Business Workflow Automation Readiness Assessment
Section 1: Repetitive Tasks & Daily Operations
Do you have routine tasks that take up valuable time?
(For example, manual data entry, repetitive email follow-ups, or routine report generation.)

Are your employees often tied up with tasks that could be automated?
(Think of processes that need to be done the same way every day, like processing invoices or scheduling appointments.)

Do you frequently experience errors due to manual handling of data?
(For instance, mistakes in data entry or miscommunication when transferring information between systems.)

Section 2: Systems Integration & Data Management
Do you use multiple software tools (such as a CRM, accounting software, or project management tools) that donâ€™t easily share information?
(This might be causing delays or data mismatches between departments.)

Are you manually updating or transferring data between systems?
(For example, copying customer details from one platform to another.)

Would you benefit from real-time updates and automated notifications about task progress?
(Imagine receiving an immediate alert when a customer inquiry is answered or when an order is processed.)

Section 3: Business Growth & Scalability
Is your business growing, leading to challenges like onboarding new employees or managing higher volumes of orders and customer requests?
(Growing pains that make it hard to keep processes efficient and error-free.)

Are you finding it difficult to scale operations due to the limitations of manual processes?
(For instance, a small team struggling to manage increased workloads during busy periods.)

Would automating some of your processes free up your team to focus on more strategic, value-added activities?
(Such as improving customer service, innovating new products, or expanding marketing efforts.)

Section 4: Process Clarity & Digital Readiness
Do you have documented, clear processes for your routine operations?
(Well-defined steps can help determine which parts of your workflow are most ready for automation.)

Is your existing technology infrastructure (like cloud services or digital communication tools) capable of integrating with automation solutions?
(A basic digital setup that could support new software without major upgrades.)

Are you open to training your team on low-code or no-code automation tools that make the setup and management easier?
(Tools designed for non-technical users can help you start automating quickly.)

Section 5: Strategic Focus & ROI Potential
Do you believe that saving time on routine tasks could directly improve your bottom line?
(If employees spend less time on repetitive work, they can focus on tasks that drive revenue.)

Would you be interested in using AI-driven analytics to monitor workflow performance and identify further opportunities for improvement?
(Imagine insights that help you pinpoint bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.)

Are you ready to invest a modest budget now for long-term savings and increased efficiency?
(Even light automation can provide significant ROI through cost and time savings.)
